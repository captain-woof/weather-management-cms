"Weather Information System" is where you can register at to view the weather at your location, plus query for data from any place, provided that we have a weather station at that place. Simply create an account and get started.

**Note: Privileged users (operators and admins)  can only be added by the site admin, the registration option on the site is only for regular users.**
